# Neovim dotfiles

Some of the configurations that I use for Neovim.

IF you are interested in looking into some of the custom features seen here:

- Split terminal window.

- Built in current directory grep.

- Command buffer with support for ANSI escape codes.

- Custom shell built into the command line buffer
